CODEBOOK GUIDE

*Overall*

**When do I use a specific code and when do I use the more general code?** Each idea should only appear once, and you should use the most specific code that is available. For example, if someone says “gas prices”, code = 2012, not 2012 AND 200.

*Administrative*

**What does “nonspecific negative expression” mean?** Just saying that the person feels that something is bad, without specifying what is bad about it. For example: “California sucks.”

*Foreign Affairs*

**What about international crises that produce refugees?** If the comment is about what refugees do _abroad_, just code this as “Foreign Affairs (General)”, = 100. If the comment is about how such people might end up in the U.S., treat this as a domestic issue and go over the 500s, finding 502 “Immigration/border/integration (non-specific)” if it is not clear whether the respondent favors welcoming such people or not. If the respondent favors welcoming refugees, the answer is then “policies favoring inclusion”, = 503.

**What about Russian interference in elections?** Since the context is almost always “Donald Trump, the 2016 election, and Russia…”, this would result in two codes: Russia = 103; “Rs threaten democracy” = 3071.

**What about the “Russian Hoax”?** This is really referring to the behavior of (mostly) liberal Democrats. Code this as “Democrats/liberals bad”, = 307. Such comments might also talk about the liberal media, which would then include as “D media” = 3042. These aren’t really foreign affairs statements.

*Economy*

**What if someone just writes “economy”?** That’s simple! Code as = 200.

**What about economic inequality?** For now, just code as “economy”, = 200, unless there is some other text surrounding it that shades the response closer to a different option.

**What if someone writes “not enough housing”?** That’s not the economy category for “cost of living,” which is nested into the personal circumstances. This is more appropriately coded as “neighborhood quality/character,” = 402.

**What about government debt?** It’s not exactly the same, of course, but it’s appropriate to code this as spending, =203. If a person is clear that they want to shrink government services or expenditure, try “oppose/shrink/control”=2031.

**What about personal taxation?** Use the general taxation complaint, =2014.

*Politics*

**What goes in the institutions category?** Anything that could be changes to the formal rules of politics. Primary reform, ending the filibuster, multi-party systems, etc. Mark the Sup. Ct., Bureaucracy (including “deep state”), and presidential power differently.

**What defines the polarization/partisanship category as separate from the party-specific ones?** This blames polarization without blaming one party or another. Can also include partisan voting behavior.

**Why not have more categories of types of Republicans/conservatives and Democrats/liberals that people can object to?** In the end, I’d likely consolidate them anyway. Basically, any complaint that is about people or ideas from that side. Comments could include: Democratic Party officials by name (as in: “Joe Biden” or “crazy Nancy”) or by group (as in: “the DNC”); Democratic-leaning voters (“the number of democrats in California”); Democratic-leaning elite participants (“liberal activists”). Anything that is on the Democratic side --- mark it here. Same for the Republicans.

**What’s the “Rs threaten democracy” category?** If someone elevates their complaint to more major instead of mundane issues: Jan. 6, coups, extremist behavior, democratic backsliding, and so on and so forth. Same for the Ds. Anything that seems to be saying that the situation goes beyond policy disagreement or differential assessments about competence.

*Social Environment*

**Does homelessness have a +/- statement?** No. Just anything about homelessness, mark it here at =4021.

*Social Organization and Status*

**Exclusion, Inclusion? What’s that about?** A lot of policies hinge on whether they are intended to help or hinder people from becoming full participants in a community, connected politically, economically, and socially. As is commonly understood, policies aimed at reducing workplace harassment are geared towards making it a more inclusive economy. These are big catch-all categories for “oh, you object to liberal stuff” or “oh, you object to conservative stuff.”

**What are “social non-judicial sanctions”?** Mentions of social penalties for behavior that are not applied by the government but are as coercive, if not more.
